<p>Figure: A schematic illustrating water mass transformation in the Labrador Sea. Warm and salty waters enter the basin via the West Greenland Current (WGC) and exit in the Labrador Current (LC) with cold and fresh anomalies, a result from the exchange between the boundary current and the cold and fresh basin interior. The resultant sharp tilt of isotherm (i.e. constant temperature surface) from the WGC to the LC suggests a strong transformation with respect to temperature space (red arrow). In contrast, the isopycnal (i.e. constant density surface) slope is comparable on both sides of the basin due to density compensation, which results in a weak diapycnal transformation (black arrow).</p>
